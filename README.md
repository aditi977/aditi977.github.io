* trying out Vite & Chakra UI component library
* automating data display using components
* might do testing at the end for UI


ideas for features
* dark mode that starts out with system preferences first and switches based on toggle (<3 dark mode>)
* color coding tags based on type of tool - framework, library, build tool, etc
* add badges for new or interesting projects
* add icons for coding tools (in tags?)
