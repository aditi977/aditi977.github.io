* trying out Vite & Chakra UI component library
* automating data display using components
* might do testing at the end for UI


ideas for features
* dark mode that starts out with system preferences first and switches based on toggle (<3 dark mode>) -- done!
* color coding tags based on type of tool - framework, library, build tool, etc
* add badges for new or interesting projects
* add icons for coding tools (in tags?) + make them multicolored 
* decide on a color scheme and make custom components based on that 
* open project images in modal + use a carousel to peruse more images
* add react prop-types validation
